    <p style="color: #729eca; font-weight: 500; font-size: 2.2em">#1 Active Directory Home Lab</p>
    <p style="color: #729eca;">
        Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that is designed to manage and store
        information about network resources, such as computers, users, and applications,
        in a centralized and organized manner. Running on VMware, with Windows Server
        2022, a full installation of SAM.lab was completed and acted as the Domain Controller.
        Installations of Windows 10 Enterprise and Kali Linux were also completed alongside
        the Domain Controller installation and were given static IP addresses as well.
        A network map diagram and completed pictures of the setup can be found
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samirjihadi/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        An AS-REP roasting attack was also executed against the Domain Controller
        using <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus" target="_blank">Rubeus</a>,
        where user passwords has Kerebos Pre-authentication disabled, allowing the hashes
        of the passwords to be stolen.

    <p style="color: #729eca; font-weight: 500; font-size: 2.2em">#2 Cable</p>
    <p style="color: #729eca;">
        <a href="https://devpost.com/software/cable" target="_blank">Cable</a> is a
        secure, open-source, and decentralized messaging platform developed
        during <a href="https://www.shellhacks.net/" target="_blank">Shellhacks 2023</a>.
        With a focus on privacy and user control, it offers end-to-end encryption,
        decentralized message storage, and cross-platform accessibility. The backend is
        built using Java, with a MySQL
        database, while the frontend is developed using Flutter. This project addresses
        the vulnerabilities of centralized social media messaging platforms, ensuring
        user data protection. As I was working on the backend and the database
        configuration of the project, our team has successfully created a functioning demo
        of Cable's user interface and made substantial progress on the backend. Future plans
        include finalizing the client-server protocol for broader adoption.

    <p style="color: #729eca;">
        <a href="http://readmylegal.biz/" target="_blank">ReadMyLegal.biz</a>, developed
        as part of <a href="https://2023.knighthacks.org/" target="_blank">Knighthacks 2023</a>,
        is a cutting-edge legal document reader powered by the latest OpenAI GPT Model. 
        It's designed to simplify legal
        interactions and enhance individual legal awareness, aiming to address the global
        decline in the rule of law. By leveraging Java for the backend, JavaScript for the
        frontend, and a REST API, users can easily upload legal documents to decode complex
        legal jargon and gain clarity on the rights and responsibilities from all parties
        involved. The project emphasizes security and accessibility, with plans to support
        more file types and enhance accessibility features in the future.
